## Exercise 3: JavaScript Basics
  
Name: **Adrian Jarelle V. Rivera**

- **Challenges Encountered:** I had trouble in figuring out how to check if the password have an uppercase, lowercase, and numeric at the same time. I used .some() method and .test() in order to check the cases. (need some changes in the validatePassword function, add a typechecking function, also in the reverseString function, return false if password is not a string)
